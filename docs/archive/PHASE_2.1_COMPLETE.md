## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Rust)

#### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Playlists table
CREATE TABLE playlists (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    item_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Playlist items (junction table with ordering)
CREATE TABLE playlist_items (
    playlist_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    media_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    position INTEGER NOT NULL,
    added_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (playlist_id, media_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (playlist_id) REFERENCES playlists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (media_id) REFERENCES media_items(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Index for efficient ordering
CREATE INDEX idx_playlist_items_position 
ON playlist_items(playlist_id, position);
```

#### **Models** (`src-tauri/src/models.rs`)

- `delete_playlist()` - Delete playlist (cascade deletes items)
- `add_item_to_playlist()` - Add media item to playlist
- `remove_item_from_playlist()` - Remove item from playlist
- `get_playlist_items()` - Fetch all items in order

- Empty states for onboarding

#### **Styling** (`src/styles.css`)

1. **Auto-play Next Item**: Infrastructure ready, player integration pending
2. **Playlist Sharing**: Single-user mode (multi-user support for future phases)
3. **Playlist Export**: No import/export functionality yet
4. **Thumbnail Generation**: Uses media poster as playlist thumbnail
5. **Search within Playlist**: Not yet implemented

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Complete E2E tests for playlist features
2. Add playlist sharing functionality
3. Implement auto-play next in player

### Phase 2.2 & Beyond
1. **Phase 2.3**: Advanced Search & Filters
2. **Phase 2.4**: Casting Support (Chromecast/AirPlay)
3. **Phase 3**: Performance optimization and production deployment

### Recommended Enhancements
- Playlist import/export (M3U, JSON)
- Collaborative playlists (multi-user)
- Smart playlists based on metadata
- Playlist analytics (most played, etc.)
- Shuffle and repeat modes
- Playlist thumbnails/cover art
