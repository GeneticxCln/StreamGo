# 🚀 Quick Start - Testing Your Optimizations

## Start the Dev Server

```bash
cd /home/quinton/StreamGo
npm run dev
```

The server will start at: `http://localhost:1420/`

## What to Test

### 1. ✅ Virtual Scrolling (Already Active)

**Test Steps:**
1. Open the app in your browser
2. Navigate to the **Library** section
3. If you have 50+ items, virtual scrolling is **automatically active**
4. Scroll through your library

**What to Look For:**
- Smooth 60fps scrolling (no jank)
- Open DevTools → Elements tab
- Search for elements with class `virtual-grid-content`
- You should see only ~20 MediaCard components rendered (not 1000+)

**Console Messages:**
```
✅ Library loaded with virtual scrolling
🎬 Rendering only visible items
```

---

### 2. ✅ Player UI Components (Auto-loads)

**Test Steps:**
1. Play any video
2. Watch the browser console

**What to Look For:**
```console
🎬 Player ready event dispatched
✅ Player UI component loaded
🎬 Quality levels available: X
💬 Subtitle tracks available: X
```

**Interactive Tests:**
- Change video quality → UI updates instantly
- Load subtitles → Control appears
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` → Stats overlay toggles
- Everything should be smooth and responsive

---

### 3. ✅ Reactive Stats Overlay

**Test Steps:**
1. While playing a video, press: `Ctrl+Shift+D`
2. Stats overlay appears in top-left
3. Shows real-time:
   - Video resolution, FPS, bitrate
   - Buffer health (color-coded)
   - Network stats
   - HLS/DASH quality info

**What to Look For:**
- Stats update every second
- Color-coded buffer health:
  - 🟢 Green = >10s buffer (good)
  - 🟡 Orange = 5-10s buffer (ok)
  - 🔴 Red = <5s buffer (poor)

---

### 4. ✅ Performance Check

**Using Chrome DevTools:**

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Performance** tab
3. Click **Record** (circle button)
4. Scroll through your library for 5 seconds
5. Stop recording
6. Check the FPS graph - should be solid 60fps

**Using DevTools Memory:**

1. Go to **Memory** tab
2. Take a heap snapshot
3. Scroll through library
4. Take another snapshot
5. Compare - memory should be stable (not growing)

---

## What You Should See

### Console Output

```console
🎬 Loading HLS.js module...
HLS manifest parsed, starting playback
🎬 Quality levels available: 5
🎬 Player ready event dispatched
✅ Player UI component loaded
💬 Subtitle tracks available: 2
```

### Performance

- **Library scrolling:** Butter smooth 60fps
- **Player controls:** Instant response
- **Quality changes:** No stuttering
- **Stats overlay:** Real-time updates

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While video is playing:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` or `K` | Play/Pause |
| `F` | Fullscreen |
| `M` | Mute |
| `←` | Seek -10s |
| `→` | Seek +10s |
| `↑` | Volume up |
| `↓` | Volume down |
| `P` | Picture-in-Picture |
| `,` or `<` | Decrease speed |
| `.` or `>` | Increase speed |
| `Ctrl+Shift+D` | Toggle stats |
| `Esc` | Close player |

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Virtual Scrolling?
- Check: Do you have 50+ items in library?
- Console should show: `✅ Library loaded with virtual scrolling`
- If < 50 items, it uses standard grid (by design)

### Player UI Not Loading?
- Check console for errors
- Look for: `🎬 Player ready event dispatched`
- If missing, player initialization may have failed

### Stats Not Showing?
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` (case sensitive)
- Check console: `Stats overlay enabled`
- Make sure a video is actually playing

### Performance Issues?
- Close other tabs/apps
- Check network connection
- Open DevTools → Console for errors
- Check DevTools → Performance for bottlenecks

```

---

## What's Different?

### Before:
- 1000 items = 1000 DOM nodes = laggy scrolling
- Manual DOM updates = slow player UI
- No reactive state = hard to maintain

### After:
- 1000 items = ~20 DOM nodes = smooth 60fps
- Reactive Svelte components = instant updates
- Centralized store = easy debugging

---

## Next Steps

### Test Everything:
```bash
# 1. Type check (should pass)
npm run type-check

# 2. Run dev server
npm run dev

# 3. Test in browser
#    - Library scrolling
#    - Video playback
#    - Quality changes
#    - Subtitle loading
#    - Stats overlay
```

### If Everything Works:
🎉 **You're done!** Your app is now optimized and production-ready.

### If You Find Issues:
1. Check console for errors
2. Check `MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for troubleshooting
