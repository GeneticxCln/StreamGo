# UI/UX Improvement and Theme Proposal

This document outlines a proposal to improve the UI/UX of the StreamGo application and add new themes.

## 1. UI/UX Improvements

### 1.1. Color Palette

The current color palette is a bit limited. I propose to introduce a more vibrant and modern color palette. Here are a few options:

**Option 1: "Vibrant Blue"**

*   Primary: #3B82F6 (blue-500)
*   Secondary: #6366F1 (indigo-500)
*   Accent: #EC4899 (pink-500)
*   Neutral: A range of grays from #F9FAFB to #1F2937

**Option 2: "Cyberpunk"**

*   Primary: #F59E0B (amber-400)
*   Secondary: #06B6D4 (cyan-500)
*   Accent: #D946EF (fuchsia-500)
*   Neutral: A range of dark grays and blacks.

### 1.2. Typography

*   Increase the base font size from 14px to 16px for better readability.
*   Use a different font for headings to create a better visual hierarchy. I suggest using a sans-serif font like "Poppins" or "Nunito" for headings.

### 1.3. Layout

*   Increase the padding and margins in some areas to create more white space and reduce clutter.
*   Use a more consistent grid system to align the elements.

## 2. New Themes

I propose to add the following new themes:

### 2.1. "Dracula"

A popular dark theme with a purple and pink color scheme.

*   Background: #282a36
*   Foreground: #f8f8f2
*   Primary: #bd93f9
*   Secondary: #ff79c6
*   Accent: #ffb86c

### 2.2. "Solarized"

A theme with a light and dark version, based on the popular Solarized color palette.

**Solarized Light:**

*   Background: #fdf6e3
*   Foreground: #657b83
*   Primary: #268bd2
*   Secondary: #d33682
*   Accent: #b58900

**Solarized Dark:**

*   Background: #002b36
*   Foreground: #839496
*   Primary: #268bd2
*   Secondary: #d33682
*   Accent: #b58900

### 2.3. "Nord"

A dark theme with a blue and gray color scheme.

*   Background: #2E3440
*   Foreground: #D8DEE9
*   Primary: #81A1C1
*   Secondary: #88C0D0
*   Accent: #EBCB8B

I will wait for your feedback before implementing these changes.
