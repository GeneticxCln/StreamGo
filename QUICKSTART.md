## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

```bash
# Frontend linting
npm run lint          # Check for errors
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix errors

# Rust quality checks
cd src-tauri
cargo fmt --check     # Check formatting
cargo fmt             # Auto-format
cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Lint with warnings as errors

# Build for production
npm run build
cd src-tauri
cargo tauri build
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Tauri API not available" error
- Make sure you're running `cargo tauri dev` from `src-tauri/` directory
- Frontend should be built with `npm run build` first

### Search returns no results
- Check TMDB_API_KEY is set: `echo $TMDB_API_KEY`
- Ensure you have internet connection
- TMDB API may have rate limits

### Library is empty
- You need to search and add items first
- Database is at `~/.local/share/StreamGo/streamgo.db`

### Add-on installation fails
- URL must be valid http/https
- Must have valid manifest.json at the URL
- Check browser console for detailed error

## üéØ What's Next?

Phase 0 is complete! The project is now ready for Phase 1:

### Phase 1 Coming Soon
- Vite + TypeScript for better DX
- HLS player support (adaptive streaming)
- Quality selection UI
- Subtitle track support
- Watchlist and favorites
- Comprehensive testing

See `EVOLUTION_ROADMAP.md` for the complete plan.

## üìù Notes

- All data stored locally (no cloud sync yet)
- API key is never sent anywhere except TMDB
- Add-ons are sandboxed with validation
- No telemetry or analytics (unless you enable in settings)

## üéâ Enjoy StreamGo!

You now have a production-ready media center with:
- ‚úÖ Real add-on system
- ‚úÖ Modern UX (toasts, modals, skeletons)
- ‚úÖ 23 configurable settings
- ‚úÖ Security hardened
- ‚úÖ Quality gates in CI

Happy streaming! üçø
